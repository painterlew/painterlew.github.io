<h3>Why was the Student Progress Policy developed?</h3>
<p>The Washington State Legislature passed legislation in 2003 requiring all of the state's public colleges and universities to 
develop policies to ensure that students complete degree and certificate programs in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>What does the policy say?</h3>
<p>Briefly, the Student Progress Policy (district policy 311) says that students are expected to make 
satisfactory academic progress while enrolled at the Seattle Community Colleges. Satisfactory progress
 means that students are passing and completing their coursework and educational programs. </p>

<p>The policy is posted on the district website under Current Students:
http://www.seattlecolleges.com/custom.aspx?page=policies&pagec=documentdisplay&policyID=pol311.</p>


<h3>Which students do the Student Progress Policy and Procedures affect?</h3>
<p>The policy to maintain a minimum grade point average applies to all students. The other two policies 
(credits earned/credits attempted and degree/certificate completion) apply to students enrolled in degree 
or certificate programs.</p>

<p>Students who are enrolled in special enrollment programs such as High School Completion, Running Start,
 certain vocational programs, international students, veterans, and students receiving financial aid may 
 have different and/or additional academic standard requirements and appeal processes. Students in these 
 programs should work with their program counselor or advisor to plan effectively and minimize these impacts
 as concerns Student Progress policies.</p>

<h3>What happens if a student does not make satisfactory academic progress?</h3>
<h3>How will a student know if (s)he is in violation of a student progress standard?</h3>
<p>Students who are in violation of one or more student progress standards will receive a letter from the college;
 it will be sent to the home address that is on record with the college Registrar's office. The letter will explain
 what the student needs to do and resources that are available to help the student meet the student progress 
 standards in the future.
