<h3>My name is XXX.</h3>
<p> This is a make up photography studio webside</p>
<p>This "about" information copy from 
<a href=" https://northseattle.edu/about-north"> https://northseattle.edu/about-north</a> </p>

<p>Established in 1970, North Seattle College provides learning opportunities for a diverse group of over 14,000 students each year.
 North is the starting point for many students who transfer to top universities across the country. Strong academic preparation and 
 advising services, small classes, an innovative integrated studies program, broad e-learning options and a variety of partnerships 
 with four-year schools contribute to student success. The College also offers three Bachelor of Applied Science degrees -  in Application
 Development,  in Early Childhood Education and in International Business - and all-in-the-evening Associate of Arts and Associate in 
 Business degree programs. </p>

<h3>Convenient Location</h3>

<p>North is located in the Northgate area of Seattle and is conveniently located near the two major north-south highways, Interstate 5 and
 Highway 99, and is just a short drive to downtown and the University of Washington. Largely residential, the campus neighborhood is near
 a large shopping district and the cityâ€™s popular Greenlake Park. The campus includes environmentally sensitive wetlands which have 
 inspired a college-wide commitment to sustainability. </p>
